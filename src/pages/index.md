  title: About Us
  description: >-
    Futura Ltd was formed from a meeting between its two directors Steve Kendall
    and Jonathan Taylor at the beginning of the Covid crisis, Steve had posted
    on a local Facebook forum that he was looking to invest in Cryptocurrency
    and was looking to meet like-minded individuals to discuss strategy.
    Jonathan responded to his post and the rest as they say is history.


    Over a number of meetings and numerous socially distanced coffees, sat outdoors in all weathers, it became clear the pair had the required IT expertise, business experience, and financial acumen which when combined would take their ideas further.


    Initially, the intention was just to mine coins for themselves, but over the next 6 months word spread quickly and a number of friends and family members expressed interest in owning their own Bitcoin mining rigs and mining from home, the only downside being the power required to operate the Rigs coupled with the noise and heat generated by the mining process and the need to educate them in regard to installation, running and maintaining each rig, It was at this point Steve and Jonathan realised if they could overcome these issues then they could develop a great business, and that is exactly what they did.


    Within the space of twelve months, Futura Ltd has grown from its humble beginnings to operating out of two secure mining facilities, with company and client’s rigs housed in state-of-the-art immersion tanks which help maximise each rigs potential to the fullest. Our rigs are located in secure mining facilities located in the North West of the UK and in Texas USA.


    Futura now offers a fully “hands-free” investment opportunity, providing custom programmed Bitcoin mining rigs coupled with a full hosting and management service which requires no involvement from clients.


    The company continues to grow from strength to strength with further expansion plans and immersion tanks on order throughout 2022 to fulfill current client demand. We welcome you to join us on our journey.click here

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
